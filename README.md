# ICP-Blockchain-EHR-System-NHS

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage DFINITY's Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to develop a secure, interoperable, and decentralized Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. Our goal is to address critical challenges in the current NHS EHR ecosystem, including data fragmentation, security concerns, and lack of interoperability.

## Key Features

- Decentralized architecture for improved data security
- Smart contract capabilities for enhanced interoperability
- Scalability to handle NHS-wide implementation
- Patient-centric data control mechanisms

## Project Status

This project is currently in development as part of an MSc Software Engineering research initiative. We are actively working on the initial proof of concept and seeking funding through the DFINITY Developer Grant Program.

## Objectives

1. Develop a secure and scalable EHR system using ICP
2. Implement robust data sharing and access control mechanisms
3. Ensure interoperability with existing NHS IT infrastructure
4. Empower patients with greater control over their medical records

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
- Frontend: React
- Smart Contracts: Motoko

## Project Roadmap

1. Core architecture development
2. Implementation of secure data sharing mechanisms
3. Development of access control features
4. Integration of interoperability capabilities
5. Comprehensive testing and security audits
