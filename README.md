# Secure, Interoperable and Decentralised Electronic Health Record System for NHS: Leveraging ICP Blockchain Technology.

## Project Overview

This project aimed to leverage DFINITY's Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to develop a secure, interoperable, and decentralised Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. The goal is to address critical challenges in the current EHR system within the NHS ecosystem, including decentralisation issues, data fragmentation, security concerns, and lack of interoperability.

## Key Features

- Decentralised architecture for improved data security
- Smart contract capabilities for enhanced interoperability
- Scalability to handle NHS-wide implementation
- Patient-centric data control mechanisms

## Project Initiative

This project was developed and submitted to the University of Bolton, United Kingdom as part of a research initiative in Partial fulfilment for the Award of MSc Degree in Software Engineering.

## Objectives

1. Develop a secure and scalable EHR system using ICP
2. Implement robust data sharing and access control mechanisms
3. Ensure interoperability with existing NHS IT infrastructure
4. Empower patients with greater control over their medical records

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) (motoko)
- Frontend: React, Html, typescript, Javascript, CSS
- Smart Contracts: Motoko

## Project Roadmap

1. Core architecture development
2. Implementation of secure data sharing mechanisms
3. Development of access control features
4. Integration of interoperability capabilities
5. Comprehensive testing and security audits
